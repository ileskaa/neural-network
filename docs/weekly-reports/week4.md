# Weekly Report 4

This week I worked on data pre-processing. I wanted to center the hand-drawn digits on the canvas before feeding them to the network. Digits of the MNIST dataset are neatly centerd, so it made sense that processing my drawings in the same manner would improve accuracy. And indeed, the results got better. For some reason, the digit "4" still seems challenging for the network to recognize. But it now gets most of the digits right most of the time.
