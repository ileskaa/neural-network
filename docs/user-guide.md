## Training a Model

From the project root, use `poetry run python -m src.model.main` to run the model's main file. This will train a new model.


## Running the App Locally

Use `poetry run flask --app src/flaskapp/app run` to start a local development server on port 5000.

You can then visit http://localhost:5000/ to view the app.
